# ROC
With the false alarm rate (FAR) as the abscissa and the probability of detection (PD) as the ordinate, an ROC curve is drawn to illustrate the variation trend of PD with FAR. An ideal detection algorithm should achieve lower FAR and higher PD. Correspondingly, the more the ROC curve deviates to the upper left, the better the detection performance of the corresponding algorithm.
# AUC
Given an ROC curve, AUC represents the area under the ROC curve. By integrating the ROC, AUC provides a quantitative indicator that can comprehensively evaluate detection performance. The more the ROC curve deviates to the upper left, the larger the AUC, and the better the detection effect.
